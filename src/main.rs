// The double colon (::) is an operator that allows us to namespace this particular from function under the String type 
// rather than using some sort of name like string_from.
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
// String can be mutated but literals cannot.
    s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

    println!("{}", s); // this will print `hello, world!`
    
}





// fn main() { // s is not valid here; not yet declared.
//     let s = "hello"; // s is valid

// } // this scope is now over, s is no longer valid.

// Ownership Rules
//
// - Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
// - There can be only one owner at a time.
// - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
